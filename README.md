## Project Description

We created a web application that lets users save and move images between their pinboards. We need you to figure out how to move these images by dragging them 

Time limit: 1 hour

## Project Statement
For dragging the images, we want users to be able to:
* Drag searched images into pinboards
* Be able to change pinboards by dragging images over the arrow for ~1 second
* Be able to drag images from one pinboard to another
* Be able to remove images by dragging them out of their pinboard
* Style images so their opacity becomes 0.75 while being dragged

Make sure to NOT delete existing DOM element class names

### Commands
Setup the project and install dependencies using "npm install"
Run the website locally using "npm start"
While the website is locally hosted, run the tests with "npm test"

If have to create pinboard:
make sure to have board-index class
